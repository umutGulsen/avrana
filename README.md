# avrana
a System Optimizer AI library

TODO list:
- Ability to save the systems
- better readme
- allowing agent to do nothing
- agent decision making based on a neural network
- ability to train the agents via evolution (with action effects as input)
- ability to train a blind agent
- stochastic inherent and action effects
- network visualization
- inherent effects graph representation
- all effects graph representation
- action effect graph visualization
- different class of agent to extract relations within a system
- ability to train the observer agent class with given output shape
- ability to train the observer agent class without given output shape
- using transformers for the observer class
- giving the observer class the ability to create ghost-states to capture hidden unrepresented effects
- thru observer class, simulating the continuation of a system state history
